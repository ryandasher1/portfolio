Here is a list of the games I've created or helped create!

## Randomized Stratego For 2 (2022)

After a few false starts in **Dreams**, where I found that creating (not awful) 3D models was particularly difficult, I settled on a concept where I wouldn't need to draw complex models or create fancy animations. Thus, Randomized Stratego was born! It was fun creating this game in **Dreams**, even though it's not a game that is well suited to the platform.

## Square Balls (2017)

My first finished solo project. As you might be able to tell, I wasn't able to rely on Sebastian's wonderful art for this release, so I kept the art style very simple and focused on creating a *relatively* tight space shooting experience. I love space shooters, and you'll be seeing more of these from me in the future! This game was also created in GameMaker and written in GML.

## The Sweeping of iVac: Afterdirt+ (2016)

A simple game the EquityArcade crew made over one weekend for Ludum Dare 37's "One Room" theme. I handled the programming using GameMaker's proprietary GML. We were really happy with the way this turned out since we were all relatively new to GameMaker at the time!
